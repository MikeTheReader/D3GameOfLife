	<h1>D3 Game of Life</h1>
	<p>
		This is an attempt at implementing 
		<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>
			Conway's Game of Life
		</a>
	    using mainly <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>. Currently, it only uses
	    it to implement the grid, but I'd like to take over for any array
	    manipulation that
	    is taking place. This is a learning project for me.
